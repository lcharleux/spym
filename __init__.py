SPyM Documentation
=================================

SPyM is a Python package dedicated to process scanning probe miscroscopy images (SPM). 

.. codeauthor:: Ludovic Charleux <ludovic.charleux@univ-savoie.fr>

Installation can be performed easily by:
  * Dirty method: copy the whole spym directory in the directory as your script using it, it will work. In fact Python first looks for modules in the current directory. This method 
  * Better method:
    
    + copying the module where you want to.
    + add the module directory to python module search path by creating a ``.profile`` file in your home directory and containing ``export PYTHONPATH=path``. Where ``path`` is the absolute address of the directory containing the abapy directory.
